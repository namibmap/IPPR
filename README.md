# IPPR
## Synopsis

The goal of this project is to map trends in allocation of Petroleum Exploration Licences (PELS) in Namibia. By structuring and mapping data, details, trends and connections in this sector, this platform will work to open up a system that is currently opaque and vulnerable to corruption. 

## Code Example (update)

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

The project will develop a system that simplifies the process of turning oil and gas exploration data into usable formats and visualizations on the web. The data gathered will aid further research which will help the public better understand the trends and signs of corruption in the sector. We want to expose these information on a publicly available website.

## Installation (update)

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference (update)

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests (update)

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
